This is an android application where landlords can post ads for their apartments and tenents can browse through all the apartments to get the necessary infortations to pick the apartment best suited for them.

Apartment list can be filtered with one or more of the folowing keys: 
a)Rent, 
b)Area(size), 
c)Number of bedrooms and/or bathrooms, 
d)If the apartment comes with or without furnishings.

Landlords can upload images of their apartments and these images will help tenents to make better judgement.

Tenents can call the landlord of the apartment they choose directly from the app for further queries and proposals.

If tenents come accross any ad that is not appropriate, they can report this ad.
